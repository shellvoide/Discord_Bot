# Discord_Bot
Setup a DiscordJS bot with ease.

## PS: I will not be going over on how to get the oAuthToken.

A Simple bash script that will help you in creating bots with ease.

- This script takes two arguments
-- 1. Name of the project (A seperate folder will be created based on this name)
-- 2. The oAuthToken (This is the secret token that is generated on the Discord Developer's website)

Usage: sudo ./MakeBot.sh <projectName> <Discord Bot Token>
- Sudo is mandatory as the program might need to install some dependencies.
  
  
# Commands to get this script up and running:
git clone https://github.com/shellvoide/Discord_Bot.git
cd Discord_Bot
chmod +x MakeBot.sh
./MakeBot.sh
